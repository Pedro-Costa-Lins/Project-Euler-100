        """ Coin Sums

        In the United Kingdom the currency is made up of pound (£) and pence (p).
        There are eight coins in general circulation:

            1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p), and £2 (200p).

        It is possible to make £2 in the following way:

            1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p

        How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?
