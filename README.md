# Project-Euler-100
## My attempts to solve the first 100 problems.

Link to the site Project Euler: https://projecteuler.net/about

Ongoing (23%), started October 17 2021.
Every program will be on a single file with their required 'data'.

I intend to use this repository as a sandbox for OOP in Python and
any new things that I learn.

I'm going to create folders dedicated to each problem group for
ease of navigation.

For any recomendations, critics and insults: pedrolins835@gmail.com

## Support Library(Ongoing):
An OOP implementation to take time and help with displaying data.

- Timing / presentation decorator (Ok)
