# Project-Euler-100
## My attempts to solve the first 100 problems.

Link to the site Project Euler: https://projecteuler.net/about

Ongoing (21%), started October 17 2021.
Every program will be on a single file with their required 'data'.

Maybe reformatting and re-do's will happen, but it is intended not to, 
so the progress on knowledge and ideas can be perceived throught time.

I'm going to create folders dedicated to each problem,
thought processes and inpirations.

For any recomendations, critics and insults: pedrolins835@gmail.com


## Support Library(Ongoing):
An OOP implementation to take time and help with displaying data.

- Timing / presentation decorator (Ok)
- Logging (Ok). But I don't think it will be used.
- Signature..?
- Implementation on (0) solutions.
