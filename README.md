# Project-Euler-100
My attempts to solve  the first 100 Euler Project problems. :)

Link to problems: https://projecteuler.net/about

Ongoing(16%), started October 2021.
Every program will be on a single file with their required 'data'.

Maybe reformatting and re-do's will happen, but it is intended not to, 
so the progress on knowledge and ideas can be perceived throught time.
