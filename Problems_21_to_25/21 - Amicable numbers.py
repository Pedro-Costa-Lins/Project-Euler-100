        If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are
        an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

        For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11,
        20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284.
        The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.
